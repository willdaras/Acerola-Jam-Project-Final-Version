The final version of my project, its a new repository because of the stupid unity rule not letting you distribute even free assets, and I had been using free gridbox prototype materials since the start of development, some of the code is a mess, but it works and I'm just happy I finished something I'm somewhat proud of within the two weeks even with school and other stuff.

Here's the game link:
